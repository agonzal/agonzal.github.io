Welcome, I'm Albert Gonzalez. I have 15+ years experience in Information Security focusing on Network Situational Awareness. 
I am a strong advocate for the principles of Newtork Security Monitoring and No PCAP then it didn't happen! I have the shirt 
to prove it. This blog will act as a dumping ground for things I fnd interesting, currently learning or playing around with. . 
Currently that could be topics on Honeypots, SIEM, Log/Packet analysis, IDS/IPS, Visualizations. Trying to learn more data-
science alongside Javascript, so expect some of that as well! Hopefully someone can benefit from what I publish here. You can 
reach out to me through the various social media links to the left or on freenode in ##security as electr0n. I founded the 
channel back in 2003, and it is currently the official topic channel for security for freenode having amassed 1000+ active users.
